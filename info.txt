Decide The DNN architecture
How to train it
Get our own data(?)
Check if changing the attn layers is the best approach

Impact

[This could alse be learned with the rest of the parts or used a more static approach]

[Check which distance is better to understand impact of a next word]
Mahalanobis Distance
Perplexity
Frechet Distance
Wassertstein Distance

[Find how to embed the words/sentences to find this differences so that different words that have a similar semantic meaning have a similar result]

Truthfulness

[Contrastive Learning]
We have one correct answer with several incorrect ones
We could use different attention layers as positive pairs or find a way to augment the attention layers so that they return a similar/same word

Use Contrastive Learning and fused that feature vector with the output of that layer to modified the next attention layer (or something like this)
Use an appraoch similar to Contrastive Learning combined with VAE


Change Direction


Last layer

Change the top-p to something with more context, using impact and truthfullnes to choose the next word
